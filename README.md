### Proposals

Focused on finding datasets that I think could work,  and less on exactly what questions to answer (before EDA):

### **Rankings of 50 States by "Freedom" in many categories from 2000-present**

Seems like a really interesting large toy dataset to play around with since the authors concede that the different variables could be weighted differently to give different rankings that emphasize freedoms of certain types instead of others.

and, where I believe the data is sourced

http://www.statepolicyindex.com/da

Lastly, there's the online book that has a lot of additional material:

### **Very detailed individual player professional soccer performance data - including what seems like 43 games from the 2018 World Cup**

Talking every pass and location on field throughout game.
