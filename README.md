# Capstone 1 Proposals

Focused on finding datasets that I think could work,  and less on exactly what questions to answer (before EDA). Open to looking further for a good dataset to work on. Here are my current proposals:

### **Rankings of 50 States by "Freedom" in many categories from 2000-present**

Seems like a really interesting large toy dataset to play around with since the authors concede that the different variables could be weighted differently to give different rankings that emphasize freedoms of certain types instead of others.


* Data: https://www.freedominthe50states.org/data

* and, where I believe the data is sourced: http://www.statepolicyindex.com/da

Lastly, there's the online book that has a lot of additional material: https://cdn.freedominthe50states.org/download/2018/print-edition-2018.pdf

### **Very detailed individual player professional soccer performance data - including what seems like 43 games from the 2018 World Cup**

Talking every pass and location on field throughout game: ![Image of individual player's passes](https://github.com/jeromekirkpatrick/capstone_1/blob/main/pass_map_soccer.png)

* Pass map from a tutorial on how to create these kinds of visualizations from the data:

* All the data is in:

### **Hearthstone tournament data**

Have a direction in mind to investigate how effective the competition structure is at rewarding its competitors performances by using data from lower level qualifying tournaments and higher level tournaments.
Saw there was an example capstone on Hearthstone, and figured I could do my own spin on one perhaps.

* Data from a webscraping aggregator site:

* Source data from tournament organizer affiliate

### **Business Bankruptcy data during COVID and mixing with other business datasets**

I was curious about this data source, Enigma, which I found through Awesome Public Datasets GitHub. Says $0.24/call. Not sure what a call is exactly.
